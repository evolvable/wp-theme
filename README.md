evolvable + _s
===

Hi. I'm a starter theme called `_s`, or `underscores`, if you like. I'm a theme meant for hacking so don't use me as a Parent Theme. Instead try turning me into the next, most awesome, WordPress theme out there. That's what I'm here for.


Getting Started
---------------
* download and unzip the theme
* add to your local wordpress' wp-content/themes/ folder
* install your node modules by running npm install at the root level of the theme
* run gulp and it will compile sass which is in src/
